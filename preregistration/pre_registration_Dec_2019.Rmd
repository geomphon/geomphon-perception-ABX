The process of perception of an unfamiliar speech sound is theorized to involve a comparison of the unfamiliar sound to representations of familiar sounds, that is sounds that have been heard repeatedly in the past.  However, research testing the ability to discriminate an unfamiliar sound often focuses on the difference betweeen the unfamiliar sound and the one familiar sound that is determined to be the "nearest" sound in perceptual or acoustic space.  This narrow focus on the one nearest sound ignores the rest of a large and often crowded represetation space.  

This is important because it is known that sound inventories of language are not random in their geometric shape, but instead can be measured to have global and local symmetry and economy, above and beyond what would be expected by chance. (Dunbar & Dupoux 2016).   We ask: does the shape of the entire sound inventory affect discirmination of an unfamiliar sound, above and beyond the effect of distance to the nearest sound? Our research has implications for theories of language change and second language acquisition and practical applications in language teaching. 


The study has been approved by  the Comité d’Éthique de la Recherche  of Université Paris Decartes as of June 13, 2019.  All funding for participant payment is covered by the Agence National de Récherche grant numbers ANR-17-CE28-0009 (GEOMPHON) and  ANR-10-LABX-0083 (EFL).   Web hosting for the online studies will be provided by the Laboratoire de Linguistique Formelle.  The study is ready to commence immediately.  

Data collection for the English speakers will take a maximum of one week to complete. Based on previous studies we expect recruitment of French participants will take longer, but we anticipate being able to run all participants within a two week window. Once data is collected all code is in place to immediately run models and create vizualizations.  At this point we will take one further week to move from a stage 1 manuscript to a stage 2 manuscript. The total time anticipated to go from in principle approval to stage 2 manuscript is one month.  

We agree to participate in the Open Peer Review system.  

Following Stage 1 in principle acceptance, we agree to register the approved protocol on the Open Science Framework either publicly or under private embargo until submission of the Stage 2 manuscript.  

If we should withdraw the paper following in principle acceptance, we agree to the publicaiton of a short summary of the pre-registered study as a Withdrawn Registration.

# Introduction
### background 
Over a lifetime of speech perception, humans fine-tune their sensitivity to phonetic differences that are contrastive in their native language.  When listeners hear a new phone, be it a phone from a new language or a variant they have not previously encountered, they are faced with the task of perceiving new sounds with a perceptual system that is tuned to their native language and dialect.   There is extensive research investigating precisely how this is accomplished. In formal models of language learning such as the Speech Learning Model (Flege) and the Perceptual Assimilation Model (Best,1995, Best & Tyler 2007), an important concept that has arisen from past work is the distance of the unfamiliar sound to the nearest familiar sound in the native inventory.  Unfamiliar sounds will be hard to discriminate from a familiar sound that is close, and easier to discriminate from a familiar sound that is farther away.

What makes two sounds "close" or "far away" is defined in different ways: principally, as either an objective acoustic distance measured on some element of an acoustic signal, or as a perceptual distance which can be measured through discrimination tasks. However, a narrow focus on the distance between one familiar sound and one unfamiliar sound ignores the crucial fact that phonetic space is crowded for most sound inventories. If we consider representations in a continous acoustic space, an unfamiliar sound which is "far" from one familar sound may also be "near" to other sounds. A familiar example is to look at the vowel space, mapped by the first formant vs second formant. The inventory of Spanish has five vowels (below, in black), and when vizualized in an f1 vs f2 they show somewhat even spacing, and a symmetrical distribution.  Let us imagine a Spanish speaker who is encountering French sounds for the first time and is attempting to add them to their mental representation.  Some french sounds will be very similar acoustically to sounds already exsisting in their inventory, and some will be very different. Also, adding a new sound to their already established inventory of sounds will also change the arrangement of sounds in the inventory. In the case of the added sounds here (in red, below),both /y/ and /ɛ/ have a similar distance to the nearest sounds in the native inventory.  However, adding /ɛ/ only does not substantially change  the symmetry of the system and creates an inventory with similar distance between each sound, whereas adding /y/ only creates an inventory that is unbalanced, has less symmetry, and has greater variation in the distances between sounds.  

 ![Alt text](250px-Spanish_vowel_chart_added_sounds.png)

This leads us to the question: Is accuracy in discriminating a new sound principally driven by acoustic distance to the nearest sound in the native inventory?  Or does the change in shape of the inventory also play a role?

We follow this line of inquiry because of previous work indicating that sound inventories are not random in their distribution of sounds (Dunbar & Dupoux 2016). Dunpar & Doupoux (2016) develop three measurements which encompass these tendencies:

1) economy ("Econ"): if two inventories have the same number of sounds, those sounds tend, all things being equal, to require relatively few features to characterize.  

2) local symmetry ("Loc") : if two inventories have the same number of sounds, using the same number of features, those sounds tend to make relatively many "minimal oppositions" between pairs of sounds, which differ only in one feature.  

3) global symmetry ("Glob"): if two inventories are matched geometrically on the other two properties, they tend to have sounds that are more symmetrically distributed.	

Because these metrics measure the geometry of an entire inventory,  we call these measures "geomphon scores." Unlike the toy example above displaying an inventory in a continuous f1-f2 space, these scores are based on discrete discrete phonological features, and visualise inventories as n-dimensional hypercubes. This allows the scores to take into account far more features than the simple two-dimensional diagram above.  Details of the precise method are available in Dunbar & Dupoux (2016).  While Dunbar & Dupoux establish that sound inventories of the worlds languages maximize these properties above and beyond the distribution expected by chance, they do not establish *why* inventories maximize these scores.  One possible reason is that inventories that maximize these scores are optimal for discrimination of sounds within an inventory.  This would lead to the prediction that a change in inventory that reduces one of these scores would lead to worse discrimination, when compared to a change in inventory that increases one of these scores. 

The motivation for this experiment is to test whether the relation of all the sounds in a phoneme inventory affect perception of a given unafamiliar sound.  Specifically, we test whether changes in geomphon scores are predictive of discrimination accuracy, above and beyond the effect of the acoustic distance to the one nearest sound in the inventory.   

To accomplish this we collect discrimination data from an ABX task. That is, listeners hear one sound ("A"), then another sound ("B"), and then a new instance of one of the previously heard sounds ("X").  Each AB pair of sounds includes one sound that is familiar (= part of the native inventory of participants), and one sound that is unfamiliar (= not part of the native inventory of participants). For each pair of sounds, we calculate the acoustic distance between sounds, and also the change in geomphon scores if the unfamiliar sound were added to the native inventory. (see more detail in Method, below)  In brief, our hypotheses are as follows:

### Hypothesis 
We hypothesize that changes in Econ, Glob, and Loc will each be predictive of discimination accuracy, above and beyond the effect of acoustic distance.   

### Predictions and operationalization of hypotheses
 Predictions  
 
 1) For each trial with sounds A, B, and X(an instance of either A or B),  we will measure the acoustic distance between A and X, and between B and X. If these distances are similar, we predict the task will be hard because this indicates that X is similar to both A and B. If, however, one of the distances is much greater than the other, it will be obvious which sound X is an instance of, and the task will be easy.  In short, we predict that the larger the difference between the measured distances (A->X) and (B->X), the higher the discrimination accuracy will be. 
 
 2) Each trial ABX will have one unfamiliar sound. Each unfamiliar sound will be given a value for how much it would change geomphon scores if it were added to the native inventory. We expect that the more a sound would cause a negative change in a geomphon score, the lower the discrimination accuracy for that sound will be.  
 
This will be analyzed using a generalized linear model with a logistic link function, implemented in a Bayesian framework.  The dependent variable will be participant accuracy. The predictors of interest will be the change in each of the geomphon scores, and the difference in acoustic distances for the two sounds in each trial.  We expect  the effect will vary by subject and by item and so we intend to include the maximum random effects structure justified by the design.  In R syntax, the model would be written as follows:  

Accuracy ~  Change_in_econ + Change_in_glob + Change_in_loc + difference_between_acoustic_distances + (1 + Econ+glob + Loc + acoustic_distance|subject) + (1|item)

Code sufficient to launch a direct replication, including all demographic surveys, instructions, and stimuli, can be found here:
-->PERSISTENT URL. 

summary of method: (more details below) The experiment is presented via an internet webrowser. Participants first read a consent form and indicate their consent. Then participants fill out a demographic survey.  In each trial, participants hear one sound ("A"), then another sound ("B""), and then a new instance of one of the previously heard sounds ("X").They are asked to indicate whether the last sound was more similar to the first sound, or to the second sound.  They indicate their choice using the keyboard.  Each trial is marked correct or incorrect. 


## sample 
#### population 
 Participants will be recruited in three venues:  
 
1) English speaking participants will be recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk, with qualifications set to:  
    * location is US  
    * approval rate 95% or higher  
    * have completed > 100 HITS  
    * following mechanical turk's policies, all Amazon Mechanical Turk participants are > 18 years of age  

2) French speaking paricipants will be recruited recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk, with qualifications set to:   
    * location is France  
    * approval rate 95% or higher  
    * have completed > 100 HITS  
    * following mechanical turk's policies, all Amazon Mechanical Turk participants are > 18 years of age
    
3) French speaking participants will also be recruited through an email list ("RISC") and the Facebook groups that focus on recruiting volunteer subjects for linguistics and Psychology research.  Speakers recruited through email and Facebook will not be paid. 

#### number of subjects 
We will sample 90 subjects. see "Model Validation"" section below for how we arrived at this number.  
  
#### Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Each participant will answer a demographic survey designed to determine their eligibility.  To incentivize truthful behavior in online participants, all Mechanical Turk participants will be paid regardless of their answers.

Data from any subject who meets **any** of the following criteria will be **excluded**.  

1) They answer "No" to question "Do you consider yourself a native speaker of English?"  (/French for french speakers )  

2) they answer "Yes" to the question: "Did you have significant exposure to a language other than English in your childhood?  Respond yes if, before age 8, you were exposed to another alnguage during a long period (at least 1 year)
This could include living in another country where this language was spoke, or having a caregiver who consistently spoke to you in this language.  Respond no if you were only exposed briefly, for example by watching TV or movies in this other language, or occasional visits to family"

3) accuracy of less than 80% on the set of ten check questions (ten ABX trials specifically designed to be easy, based on acoustic distance and former pilots. see "stimuli" below)

We will run a batch of 90 subjects and then  determine the number of subjects that pass all the above criteria.  We will then run batches of size (90 - number who passed the criteria) until we reach 90 subjects.  Each batch of data will be posted to OSF in raw, anonymized format on the day of collection, before a new batch is collected. 

## Stimuli 

### Choice of unfamiliar language:  
 For practical reasons our discrimination experiments are to be run with English and French listeners, and therefore it was necessary to find a language which has some sounds that are similar to sounds in the inventory of French and English, and some sounds that are highly dissimilar. In addition, the unfamilar sounds should involve a variety of changes in geomphon scores, as well as in acoustic distances. 

While geomphon scores can be calculated based on a full inventory of consonants and vowels,  practically speaking, discrimination between pairs of sounds consisting of one vowel and one consonant would yield ceiling level accuracy and be uninformative for our research question. We therefore chose to use only consonants. 

 For the purposes of choosing a language, we were interested not in the geomphon scores of the entire inventory, but rather the *change* in geomphon scores if sounds from a new inventory were added to either English or French.  For each sound in an unfamilar language, we calculated the change in geomphon scores from the base value for English compared to the value for English and French if the sound in question was added to the inventory.   (For details of how the scores were calculated, see section "Calculation of geomphon scores" below)

We identified Hindi as the best candidate lagnauge because it was a language that has many consonants that are familiar to French and English speakers (e.g. /n/,/m/, /b/, /j/), and also many that are unfamiliar (in particular, retroflex sounds,  and voiced aspirated stops). It also showed variation in the change in geomphon scores, and is a language for which we would be able to recruit model speakers in France and the United States. 
 
### Procedure for recording of stimuli: 
 
5 Hind-Urdu speakers (3 female) were recorded in a sound attenuated booth in either the Université de Paris or the University of Massachusetts.   All reported that Hindi was the principal language they spoke with their family as children.  The primary motivation for using multiple speakers was to introduce variability and noise into the experiment, to avoid ceiling-level accuracy. Because we were specficially interested recruiting speakers who were not acoustically similar, the speakers were not controlled for sociolinguistic factors (e.g. age, place of birth,etc.) Each speaker was paid  $20/€20 for their recording and signed an informed consent form.  
 
 Participants spoke all consonants of Hindi in a pseudoword /a_a/ context.  Each pseudo word was written on a list in Devanagri and latin script, with a sample word in Devanagri including the target consonant sound.  For elicitation purposes each pseudoword was said in a sentence context "kripya ____ kahie" (कृपया_____कहिए") ("please bring _____"). Speaker 1 recorded all peseudowords once.  Speakers 2-5 recorded all pseudowords twice.  The  first time, speakers 2-5 listened to speaker 1, and then paused the recording and repeated after Speaker 1.  They were told to try to repeat at about the same pace.  Recordings are considered individually identifiable information and so are not available publically, but are approved for sharing for research purposes, including replication. To obtain access to the files email ewan.dunbar@univ-paris-diderot.fr.  

Textgrids for all recordings were created using forced alignment using  the Penn forced aligner. Transcripts, code, and textgrids are available at URL_______.  All textgrids were hand checked and ajusted for accuracy in Praat, and all splice points were moved to the nearest zero crossing.  
 
#### Experiment design
 
Each trail tests one pair of phonemes. One member of the pair is a familiar sound, and one member is an unfamiliar sound.   The "familiar" sounds were phones that are included in both French and English inventories (i.e. would be transcribed as the same IPA symbol in French, English, and Hindi).  The familiar sounds are listed below: 
"ɾ"   "g"   "l"   "n"   "d"   "kʰ"  "tʰ"  "t͡ʃʰ" "b"   "m"   "d͡ʒ"  "ʃ"    


The unfamiliar sounds, on the other hand, were sounds which are  present in the inventory of Hindi but unambiguously absent in both French and English. Starting with the full complement of unfamiliar sounds, we used domain knowledge to decide which  Hindi sounds we used. Specficially, we ruled out  the velar fricatives, which were not native to our speakers' dialects. Additionally, we excluded /ɽʰ/, which one of our speakers, a native speaker and expert in linguistics, warned us might be variable, and indeed was found to be highly variable in acoustic distance, indicating that our speakers varied greatly in their pronunciation.   The unfamiliar sounds are listed below:

"ɳ"   "ɽ"   "ɡʱ"  "ʈʰ"  "bʱ"  "dʱ"  "ɖ"   "ɖʱ"  "d͡ʒʱ  


We have an estimate of the effect of acoustic distance based on other pilots with different stimuli (for details see section "acoustic distance" in the statistical model section). When chosing which familiar sounds to pair the unfamiliar sounds with, we found that pairs of sounds with large differences in acoustic distance were close to ceiling performance in discrimination. Therefore, it was a priority to pair unfamiliar sounds with similar familiar sounds. (e.g., pairing /bʱ/ with /b/ , which are quite close in acoustic distance, rather than, say, /m/ and  /"d͡ʒ/ which are very far in acoustic distance)  To build our design, we first calculated the mean difference in acoustic distance for all instances of each pair of stimuli. We then estimated discrimination accuracy based on these new acoustic distance measures, and our previously found effect of acoustic distance.  For each unfamiliar phone, we selected the four unfamiliar-familiar pairs that were the closest in terms of acoustic distance (see section "acoustic distance", below), and therefore would likely be difficult to discriminate. Four was chosen because it would facilitate counterbalancing (see next paragraph) Examples of the pairs for  /ɡʱ/ and /bʱ/ are below.

ɡʱ,d  
ɡʱ,g  
ɡʱ,kʰ  
ɡʱ,tʰ  
bʱ,b  
bʱ,kʰ  
bʱ,m  
bʱ,tʰ  

It is important to clarify that both the familiar and unfamiliar sounds were spoken by the Hindi speakers.  Because they were spoken by Hindi speakers, the "familiar" sounds may differ systematically from the English and French version of these sounds. The rationale for recording in this way was to have consistency in the context surrounding the phone of interest.  If instead English speakers recorded the English consonants and Hindi speakers the Hindi consonants, the surrounding vowels have the potential to give additional cues useful for discrimination and push discrimination towards ceiling. While the "familiar" sounds may differ slightly from their versions in English and French, the unfamiliar sounds were chosen to be much further than unfamiliar sounds in acoustic distance and phonological features.
  

Once the pairs of phonemes were chosen, it was necessary to combine recordings of the sounds to create ABX trials. An ABX trial consists of a sound (A), a different sound (B), and then a repetition of either A or B (the X, which participants match to either A or B).  For a trial with a given pair of phonemes, it is necessary to determine the order of the phonemes, and which sound was the target (that is, whether X should be matched to A or B). Order and target status were counterbalanced in a latin square design. The number of trials was constrained to no more than 150 based on time estimates of previous experiments, and so the latin square design was repeated four times, creating a design with 144 trials. Given this number of trials, it was not possible to also counterbalance all combinations of all five speakers and the phone pairs. Instead, the design was submitted to simulated annealar script which will optimize a stimuli list that, to the greatest extent possible, decorrelates speaker combination from phone pair.

### experimental procedure
All code sufficient to launch an exact replica of the experiment is available at ______URL)
Participants first listen to a sample audio file and are given a chance to adjust their volume. Then, they read a consent form and indicate their consent. Next participants fill out a demographic survey. Participants are given insturctions as to how to complete the trials. In each trial, they use the spacebar to play the audio file of three sounds, and are asked "Was the third sound was more similar to the first sound or the second sound ?" Participants use the keyboard keys to indicate their answer. Responses are not registered until the audio has stopped playing. Paricipants complete 10 practice trials, with no feedback. The practice trials are chosen to be easy, in order to give the participant a chance to familiarize themselves with the method. The experiment itself consists of 144 test trials and 9 check questions, broken up into three blocks.  The order of trials and the presentation of check questions is randomized for each block. After the experiment, participants are given a post-experiment survey, which allows them to report any technical problems, and to guess the purpose of the experiment. 


#Statistical Model 
Statistical models are generalized linear mixed effects models with a logit link function, implemented in a Bayesian framework. Models are specified using R and brms(), and all code is available at _________

##model specification
#### dependent variable
The dependent variable is accuracy, interpreted as a binary 1 (= correct) or 0 (= incorrect)

####covariates 
the covariates in the model are the difference in geomphon scores, and the acoustic distance.  
The geomphon scores are defined for each unfamiliar phone, and therefore all pairs that include a given unfamiliar sound have the same difference in geomphon score, for a total of 9 different geomphon scores, one for each unfamiliar phone. The acoustic distance, on the other hand, is calculated for a given set of recordings, and so each of the 144 trials have a different acoustic distance score. 

#####geomphon scores 
For details on geomphon scores see section "calculation of geomphon scores", above

#####acoustic distance 

Our prediction states that "For each trial with sounds A, B, and X(an instance of either A or B),  we will measure the acoustic distance between A and X, and between B and X. If these distances are similar, we predict the task will be hard because this indicates that X is similar to both A and B. If, however, one of the distances is much greater than the other, it will be obvious which sound X is an instance of, and the task will be easy.  In short, we predict that the larger the difference between the measured distances (A->X) and (B->X), the higher the discrimination accuracy will be."  For this method, it was important to establish a way to measure acoustic distance, and a way to approximate the difference between the A-X and B-X distance. 

 We tested our methods using three sets of ABX phone discrimination pilot data:

- **Pilot-a:** Cross-linguistic (English/French) ABX phoneme experiment, lab speech, three speakers A-B-X, presented to English and French listener groups
- **Pilot-b:** TIMIT ABX phoneme experiment, from corpus, three speakers A-B-X, presented to English and French listener groups
- **Pilot-c:** English lab speech ABX phoneme experiment, two speakers AB-X, presented to English and French listener groups


For all pilots, we compared distances calculated by MFCCs with distances calculated by "bottleneck features"  trained on a multilingual corpus (Silnova et al. 2018). We found that in all three pilots, there is a clear advantage for the multilingual bottleneck features over MFCC features in predicting the human responses. Additionally, we wanted one measure to encompass the difference between the A-X distance and the B-X distance.  We tested a simple difference, a ratio, and the log transformed ratio score. We found that the log(distance ratio) provided a linear effect, with the bigger the log(distance ratio), the lower the accuracy.  
Based on the effect of acoustic distance from previous pilots, we were able to estimate the acuracy for each pair of sounds in the present experiment. As stated in section "Experiment Design," we then selected familiar-unfamiliar pairs which were very similar (pairs with a higher log(distance ratio), that is pairs on the righthandside of the graph below ), in order to ensure both that the experiment would be diffcult enough, and also that our log(distance ratio) values fell within the linear portion of the trend below.

##Model validation and power analysis 
Geomphon scores have never, to our knowlege, been used as predictors of discrimination in a similar experiment. 
Additionally, their scale is arbitrary.  Given this, we have no data on which to estimate the scale of their effect on discrimination (if any), and no way in which to calculate a traditional power analysis.  We were motivated to ensure that, given our experimental design, our model specification would differentiate between a small, positive effect, and a zero effect.  In order to be confident that our experiment design and model specification is sufficiently sensitive to capture an effect, should it be present, we tested the sensitivity of our model setup, and also of our model comparison technique, using data sampled with a known effect. 

###1) How closely does our design and model specification return the effect of the true data generating process?

We test the sensitivity of our model by sampling data in R with a known effect of our coefficients of interest, and then 
calculating the difference between the mean of the posterior distrubution output by the model, and the true value used an an input to the sampling procedure. 

Specifically, we investigate the effects of the following things on model sensitivity:
1. the experiment design used for each subject  (=number of trials per phone pair)
2. the number of subjects  (= total amount of data)
3. the size of the effect. 

#### experiment design 
As explained above in section "Experiment design" the design of the experiment is fixed based on the number of unfamilar sounds in Hindi, and on the length of pilot experiments. 

#### amount of data 
With the experiment design fixed, the amoung of data is determined by the number of subjects. To determine the number of subjects necessary to achive high acuraccy in detecting a known effect, we tested directly by sampling datasets based on a variety of values of coefficients, and then running models to detect these known coefficient values.

We graph below the difference between the value input as the coefficient and the mean of the posterior for 27 combinations of values (All combinations of 3 coefficient values (-1,0,1),  for  the three geomphon scores) .  In the best case scenario the mean of the posterior is exactly the same as the coefficient value we used to sample the data, and therefore the difference shown on this graph is zero. We can see that the distribution approaches zero as the number of subjects increases. 

An N of 90 subjects was selected as the best balance between the practicalities of running many subjects and the extent to which the mean of the posterior distribution would reflect the true value.

###2) Does our model comparison technique consistently discriminate (small) positive effects from zero effects?

#### method to determine whether an effect of a coefficient is non-zero 
Based on our design we expect acoustic distance will be non-zero. (indeed, we have specifically designed the stimuli and selected the design to ensure this is the case, and our interpretive plan, below, reflects this.)
 
The effect of the geomphon scores, however, is as yet undetermined, and may be larger or smaller than the effect of acoustic distance. Therefore, a significant concern was to determine a model that would detect a difference between a small, positive effect and a zero effect. 

To this end, we use Bayes factor model comparisons of models specified with truncated priors.  A truncated prior is simply a prior for which the density curve is truncated at some value. 

In our case, we are interested in detecting the difference between a small, positive value and a zero effect.  We will compare two models: 

Model A)  a model which includes the effects of all three geomphon scores, each with a Normal prior centered around zero and truncated to be >= 0

accuracy ~ change_in_econ + change_in_econ + change_in_loc + log(acoustic_distance_ratio)   
   priors:   
    change_in_econ   N(0,10), trucated >=0  
    change_in_glob   N(0,10), trucated >=0  
    change_in_loc    N(0,10), trucated >=0  
    log(acoustic_distance_ratio)  N(0,10)  
    
The advantage for a truncated prior here is that if there is a small positive affect, the prior gives extra weight in order to differntiate this from zero. 

Model B)  The "zero model." This model removes the effects of change_in_econ, change_in_glob, and change_in_loc, simulating a zero effect for all three.   
accuracy ~log(acoustic_distance_ratio)   
   priors:   
    log(acoustic_distance_ratio)  N(0,10)  

#### random effects structure 

 We expect variation by subject and by item.  We will include random slopes and intercepts for subjects, and random slopes and intercepts by item, creating the maximal random effects structure justified by the design, following Barr (2013) 
 
 
 

# Results & Analysis 

### Preprocessing 
Data will be filtered for whether it confirms to criteria outlined in subejct inclusion/exclusion above.    All data from any subject that meets the selection criteria will be used. 

### reality checks 
Our hypotheses take for granted an effect of acoustic distance.  Therefore, an effect of acoustic distance is a required first step before interpreting the geomphon scores.(see interpretive plan, below)
  

# Interperative plan 

step 1: confirm effect of acoustic distance by re-creating the same log(distance ratio) vs. accuracy by phone pair graph in section "acoustic distance" above.   The effect of acoustic distance should mirror past pilots and sampled data in showing a negative, linear trend. 


possible outcomes:

a) there is no effect of acoustic distance, or the effect varies greatly from previous pilots. 
  
We will interpret this as a failure to replicate the effect of acoustic distance. Given that the stimuli were chosen specifically to have an effect of acoustic distance, that the number of subjects was chosen specifically to be able to robustly detect this effect, and that three previous pilots show significant effects of distance, we will we will consider this a fatal failure of the experimental protocol.  We will withdraw the study and pre-register a new experimental protocol with more subjects and/ or an easier task in order to detect the effect of acoustic distance. 

b) there is an effect of acoustic distance 

We will interpret this to be a confirmation that our experimental protocol was well-designed to detect the effects of interest. 


step 2:  examine the effect of geomphon scores

possible outcomes: 

a) Model comparison shows an advantage for Model A, which includes effects of one or more of the geomphon features.  
We will interpret this as a confirmation of our hypothesis, and consider it evidence that at least one of these scores is predictive of human discrimination

b) Model comparison shows an advantage for Model B, or no difference between Model A and Model B. 
We will interpret this as a rejection of our hypothesis, and consider it evidence  that there is no effect of geomphon scores on discrimination accuracy once acoustic distance has been taken into account.
