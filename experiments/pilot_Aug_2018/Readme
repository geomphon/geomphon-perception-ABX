This folder contains the files for the Aug 2018 Pilot 

This differs from the July pilot in two ways. 
    1 new stimuli 
      -stimuli recorded in sound booth by native English speakers 
      -both vowels and consonants 
    2 new presurvey-  improved language in demographic questionnaire 



TO CREATE STIMULI:

1. Stimuli folder containing
	-full recordings of stimuli (ewan.wav,amelia_consonants.wav,amelia_vowels.wav)
	-their accompanying textgrids  (amelia_consonants_ONLY_TARGET_CHECKED.TextGrid etc)
		-these textgrids have a tier (2) with only the target word (no recording context)
		-these textgrids have been handcheecked for accuracy after running forced aligner

2. save_intervals_to_wavs.Praat :script for cutting out just target words and saving them as separate .wavs. NB the output directory specified here must exist already, the script will fail rather than create one if you specify a directory that does not exist. 

3. scale_intensity.Praat: script for normalising intensity of all files in a directory. 

4. triplets.csv:  a list of all possible triplets 

5. create_stimlist.py : a script that takes triplets.csv and filters it to create a stimuli list, then outputs a stimlist which is saved to the concatenation folder (NB as a .txt file! Praat does not like .csvs in this specific moment), as well as a two new LMEDs sequence file (English/French)

6. concatenation_of_tripets.Praat : takes the stimlist created by create_stimlist.R and the .wavs created by save_intervals_to_wavs.Praat (which have been normalised by Normalize_intensity.Praat), and creates triplet files. Note that all files must be the same sampling frequency, even silences

7. Bash script geomphon_Aug_2018.sh which runs all the above 6 steps in the above order. 



To create new  LMEDS setup for experiment: 
1. UPDATE BY HAND
		-update LMEDs dictionary (with new experiment finish code for turkers, if nothing else)
		-(if necessary update sequence file to reflect new stimuli)
		-(if necessary update surveysâ€” If update, then update cleaning script by hand)
		-update .cgi file 
		-update output folder to have name that is the same as the sequence file name

2. Use makefile to add your updates to stable version of LMEDS 

3. Push updates to server 

4. Update server permissions to allow experiment to run
   -cgi must be executable 
   -output folders must have write permissions.
