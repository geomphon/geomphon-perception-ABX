The only make command currently working properly is make triplet-list.

We moved all files concerning this command and reorganised them, and edited the makefile to automate it.
We created a tmp file which holds all files that should be deleted after their uses.

Weâ€™re trying to do the same with the commands make distance and make stimuli.
